Tried perforce and local server works.

But Adrian Telus cannot log in to gateway, we cannot forward to modem port to his PC.

Github not good, there's 1GB limit.

We used Onedrive at last, pull folders onto my files and this will be the latest version we edit.

Both me and Adrian set up perforce local on our PC. I taught him how to do that. And here's the doc:[https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/troubleshooting/pipeline/ts-p-0004](https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/troubleshooting/pipeline/ts-p-0004)

So Onedrive main sharing edit, and we are the only two editing the file.

File structure: Universal assets, like a sewer level with camera. Each shot has different assets, like books. Picture object oriented programming. Universal is the blueprint, shots are actual adding different assets in.

Perforce local for back ups, both of us using it just in case.

But, we burst into the problem that the server will have bug if we start manually. I'll fix that next week.
