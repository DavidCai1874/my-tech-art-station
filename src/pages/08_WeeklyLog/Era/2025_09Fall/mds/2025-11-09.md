Portfolio:

Ask John:
I'm thinking about my tool part for my portfolio:

Existing:
- \-Face Index C++ Tool
- \-Animation Blocking Tool

Working: (Maya UE Tool Bundle)
- \-Maya grid + geo size
- \-Auto export to maya and adjust pivot center(from last week's feedback)
- \-Auto create UE Material
- \-two shaders

Planning:
- \-Reference and camera managing tool in Maya
- \-Auto control and auto group

Speaking of my website, do you think it will be helpful if I put the link in my resume or CV and be like "Hey my docs"?
