Changed the nav bar. I don't think I can finish the gallery section right now, and I don't have the shader knowledge to build interesting FX to put in the playground section for now. Up is how it looks when I comment out these two sections. But now it looks really unbalanced, so I decided to move the WIP section to the left and make the space in between larger. Below are all the functions for now; I'll add more once I unlock more of my skill tree.

The new 2025 Fall section for weekly logs, I'm ready for new things.
