Continued learning Maya coding. The book I read was around 10 years old â€” too old; it even describes ways of retrieving data by creating a local server lol.

Speaking of my website, I changed the color palette a bit, read through the code, and gradually began to understand some of it. At least I finished the Work In Progress part and am now able to visually see what I'm working on.
