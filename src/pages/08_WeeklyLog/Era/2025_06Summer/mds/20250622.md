Worked on some C++ for Maya; it took some time, and I had a bit of a mental breakdown due to slow progress and the long list of summer tasks. But still, I managed not to get overwhelmed by emotions and didn't blame myself too much on that haha.

I didn't work on my website this week.I guess I'll put it aside for a while. But for sure I'll try to finish it before Sep.
