I am writing this a day after it was supposed to be written, but I feel quite fine because today, June 30th, I finished reading most of the Maya code I collected (except for the PySide2 parts) and began planning the Maya tool part of my portfolio.
It took me 2 months to understand Python and C++ in Maya—a quite long journey. I plan to finish the tools within a week and a half, which is approximately 10 days. I'll update my progress here, but it seems like my website won't be updating until mid-August, haha... 
Anyway, after this long Maya trip, after climbing the last bit of this mountain, I'll begin working in Unity with shaders and polish the game. Finally, I feel like a bamboo shoot that has been buried in the earth for eternity, now finally seeing some hope of blooming.
