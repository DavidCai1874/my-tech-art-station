Take a break for a few days and adjust how my TA plan should go â€” just take it slow and do something every day, then it'll be fine. This means that besides doing my tech stuff, I'll be working on my website too. I'm getting my energy back after a day's break.

P.S. This is written four days after Sunday. I'm working on a C++ maya tool right now.
