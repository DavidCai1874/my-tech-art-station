# 2025-07-27

The past week was actually... not that friendly to me. Something happened, I got really burned out for several days, didn't work on anything. But things have kinda gotten back on track by today, July 27th. I believe I just need some more sleep and some more time. Things will get better.

Beautiful, isn't it?

May the sun heal everything â˜€
