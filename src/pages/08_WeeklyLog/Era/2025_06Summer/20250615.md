I was working with Maya's Python this week and didn't update the website much. Mainly, I was learning how to program with OpenMaya and OpenMayaMPx (for custom things). It feels like opening a time capsule from 30 years ago, full of old, but now redundant scrolls that were once used for dragon flame casting and now only have the depleted effect of a stove lighter. But I'm glad I made it through and now have some basic understanding. I'll start watching Zurbrigg's tutorial next week. I probably won't be working on my website for a while until I am temporarily done with the Maya Python part of my portfolio.
