I made this little Pomodoro timer because I wanted **a simple, safe timer** that I know every line of code, so it can't harm my PC. Plus, I don't want any fancy features that might distract me from working.

For me, working in these 25 min cycles is a good way to balance work and drinking water lol.

It **runs in the background while you're working**, and it also **stays on top during breaks**, so you won't forget to start counting down again when you get back to work.

I didn't add a 5-minute break countdown in between becuase sometimes I need to lie down and rest my back rather than being called up to sit again in such a short time.

**After 4 rounds, it closes by itself**. Simple but strict, rest and work.

I wrote this with the sleep(1) function at first, which made the program stop for a second after each countdown tick, causing the timer to lag so much. So I updated it to count down every 1000 ms, aka one Mississippi.
