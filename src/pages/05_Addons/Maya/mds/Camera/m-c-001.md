Maya's default index display can be heavy to use when the face, vertex, or edge count is high. That's why I created this tool, it can ignore back-facing faces and adjust the display area.

Here's the panel: the upper half is the display options, and the lower half includes options for hiding back-facing faces and highlighting the selected index.

This is especially helpful when working on procedural modeling.

The method for determining the facing angle uses some computer graphics concepts. Every face has a normal direction. When light shines on a face, the cosine of the angle between the normal and the light direction is calculated. This gives a ratio, which is then multiplied by the light intensity. Same here, this tool calculates the ratio; if it's smaller than the cosine of a certain angle, the index will not be shown.
