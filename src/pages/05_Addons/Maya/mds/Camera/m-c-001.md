Maya's default showing face is so bad, doesn't have the ability to hide the back side, the only way of trying to get some face index is the output in script editor 
that's why I made this, it can ignore the back side faces, and adjust the showing area. This is computer graphics, cos value and normal angle. and showing type in one click
