# Relative Pose Copy Tool

This is a beta version tool.

When copying certain poses, I might not want them to look exactly the same. I want them to be different, based on the root's position. The panel looks like this:

Basically, just select the root of the hierarchy you want to copy, then select the root of the target hierarchy, and hit the copy button.

This is different from other pose copying tools because it pastes based on hierarchy, not name or object type. For example, I can copy the positions of a row of cubes to a row of cones. The result looks like this:

If I rotate the root of the row of cones before pasting, the result follows the root's transform.

This works based on the equation: **world space = local space * parent space**.

So, I only need to collect the local transform info of the cones relative to their root. Then, by multiplying by the new parent transform (the target root), I can achieve that result.
