# Animation Blocking tool

#### animation, python

This idea came from a conversation with my friend. It's a bit clunky if I don't have another screen, or if I have to select all the keys and hit block manually. But this blocking tool does it all with just one click.

The window looks like this, kinda intimidating, but don't panic!

Let me explain. Before actually blocking the animation, the tool does three things: picks the attribute, filters the type of items, and sets the frame range.

The two buttons at the very bottom do two things: block the animation, or unblock (spline) it.

That's all! If you're interested, take a look: [https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Maya-Animation-Blocking-Tool](https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Maya-Animation-Blocking-Tool)
