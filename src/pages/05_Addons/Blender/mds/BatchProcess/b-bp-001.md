Blender doesn't provide a batch import function. Usually, you have to select and import files one by one, which is tedious and time-consuming. That's why I made this addon.

The buttons are straightforward, supporting OBJ and FBX batch import.

Now, I'm able to select multiple OBJ/FBX files and bring them into my scene.
