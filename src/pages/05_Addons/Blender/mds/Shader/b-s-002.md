I use Blender version **2.90.0**, and this shader does not run in other versions.

This tool was created after I saw Gaku Tada's works and felt inspired.

As I mentioned in [Shader Library 1](https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/addons/blender/b-s-001), doing everything by code for shaders in Blender is **not the best practice**, and this only works in this specific version.

Here's how the panel looks:

It does two things: adds a material to the selected object and adds a lineframe outside of the selected object.
