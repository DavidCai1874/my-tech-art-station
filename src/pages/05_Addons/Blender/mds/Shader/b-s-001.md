#### shader, python

The Blender version I use is **4.1.1**, and this does not run in other versions.

This is an addon I made when I started learning Python in Blender almost a year ago, **done purely by coding**â€”using code to create nodes, adjust certain values, and connect outputs and inputs together.

This is **not the best practice** because Blender has a feature that, if you open an old file with a newer version, the newer version will recompile all the materials in the file to make them display correctly. And if everything is done by code, it only works in one Blender version. When outputs change their place in next Blender version, this code is going to complain. So, the best way to create a shader library is to **store them in a Blender file** and open that file with the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Blender every once in a while. Then, **use code to import them**.

Anyway, the shader library looks like this:

There are two reasons I made this: first, I wanted to try out my Python knowledge; second, I thought it would be cool to have some quick materials available with just one click, for a quick preview.
