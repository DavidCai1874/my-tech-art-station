This is the upgraded version of the code mentioned here: [What If I Only Keyframed Viewport Visibility In Blender](https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/troubleshooting/blender/ts-p-0001)

The addon looks like this:

When you hit the "Hide Objects" button, it will hide objects **in both render and viewport**.

Likewise, the "Show Objects" button will show the objects in both render and viewport. The "Insert Visibility Keyframe" button **keys the visibility animation on both channels**. The **auto keyframe** does the same thing when it **detects visibility state changes**.

And lastly: In the specials, it can show all hidden objects **without inserting a keyframe**, and embeds the code that **syncs the viewport and render visibility keyframes**.

Story time:

This all started with a morphing animation I was working on. These are part of the final result:

And, obviously, I'm the person who forgot to key the render visibility. I rendered the first half and was like, "Why are the cactus and other things still there..."

Unfortunately, I didn't get the script to work at that timeâ€”it keyed every frame and worked SO SLOW.

But luckily, I was using Eevee to render, so I used the viewport render and the result was quite acceptable.
