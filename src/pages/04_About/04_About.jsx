          Why I built this website is because I believe knowledge should be public, logical, and honest. I created this site so people can find solutions, or at least can have someone to ask for help. I don‚Äôt want to see the same bugs and issues pop up over and over again. 
          I personally find reading well-structured docs is a much better experience than rewatching YouTube tutorials, especially when I‚Äôm troubleshooting the same thing for the second (or third!) time.
          This website is still just starting, but my goal is to share what I learn and maybe leave something useful behind.
