The Unreal Engine version I use is **5.3.2**.  
The Maya version I use is **2024**.

**Note:** This is **not an ideal way to build the entire pipeline**, but it is **a good way for importing blocking models** into UE. The advantage is that it keeps the scene looking exactly the same; the disadvantages are that the shading might be incorrect, the size might be off, and the rig data is huge.

Abstract:
- \-**Activate the USD plugin** in both Maya and UE.
- \-Export your Maya scene as a .usd file and check **Animation Data**.
- \-**Stage your USD file in UE**, and the sequencer is under the stage actor.

***

1\. Open your UE project and go to **Edit -> Plugins**.

2\. Search for "usd" and **enable the USD Import Plugin**. Then restart your project.

3\. In Maya, open the scene you have already built. Go to **Windows -> Settings/Preferences -> Plug-in Manager**.

4\. Search for "usd" and make sure the plugin is loaded (it is usually loaded by default).

5\. Here is the sample scene I built: Tom jumping.

6\. Go to **File -> Export All**.

7\. At the bottom of the pop-up window, choose **USD Export** and name your file.

8\. On the right side panel of the pop-up window, choose the .usd File Format as ASCII (Binary should work too), and make sure you **check Animation Data and Use Animation Range**. Then **export**.

9\. In your UE project, go to **Window -> Virtual Production -> USD Stage**.

10\. Open the .usd file you just exported from Maya.

11\. You may be prompted to create a USD Asset Cache. Since this doc is just using USD for rough blocking, **create a new cache** (no need to explain what it does here).

12\. Now, rotate your viewport and your scene should be loaded, but **the size might be incorrect**—either too big or too small.

13\. Scale it to the desired size. The camera may also be oversized, so you can delete it.

14\. Go to **Outliner and select UsdStageActor**. At the very bottom, there is a **Level Sequence—double-click** that.

15\. Now your animation is loaded too. Play the sequence and enjoy. (FYI: Notice how many items are present; it's not ideal to export fully finished rig animations—only rough blocking may work.)
