Abstract:
- \-Enable Allwrite when creating a workspace
- \-Use Reconcile to collect changes instead of Add

***

1\. Perforce has a file-locking feature that makes a file read-only unless you check it out. **This is annoying for local users.**

**To avoid this, when creating your workspace and on the Advanced page, enable the "Allwrite" option.**

This option makes files writable even if they are not checked out, so you can edit them at any time.

2\. Perforce has a handy feature called **"Reconcile,"** which gathers all the changes you made including edits, deletes, and new files. You can access it by **right click on a folder/file.**

As a local user you'll use this very often. Move it to the top of the context menu: go to **Edit -> Preferences.**

**In Context Menus, drag "Reconcile Offline Work" to the top, click Insert Separator to separate it from other functions, and remember to Apply.**

Now it appears at the very top of the right-click menu.

3\. After these two settings, you'll have a comfortable local workflow. **You don't need to keep P4V running all the time, only open it when you're ready to submit changes.** P4D (the server) runs in the background with minimal memory usage and not eating any CPU or power. **Avoid changing server settings and leave it at the default, otherwise things will be a bag of bugs.**

When you're ready to add your changes to a changelist, **right click -> Reconcile Offline Work (this works even if you're online)**. In the dialog, **check both options,** they track your files and ignore useless caches.

Then select the red triangle (the changelist), click Submit, add a description, and you're done. That's what you do everytime after you finish working and want to submit to the version control.
