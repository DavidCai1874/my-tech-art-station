Abstract:
- \-Everything in Maya is node, and every node can be pointed and manipulated by packed MObject.

***

When you open Maya, there's a tool under "Windows" called the "Node Editor."

It is empty when you first open it.

But when you create a basic cube, something appears in it. **These are called "nodes."**

Nodes can do different things. For example, **polyCube1 is the construction node** that controls the parameters of how the cube is built — width, height, depth, subdivisions, etc. You can find it in the channel box.

The pCubeShape1 node contains the final shape information of the cube, and pCube1 is the transformation node, aka the "where the cube is in the scene" node.

Now let's create a layer and add the cube to it. In the Node Editor, you can see layer1 connects to pCube1. **Everything you do in Maya is just nodes connecting to each other and sending data.**

A NURBS circle is also made up of several nodes!

And constraints, such as the aim constraint here, are also **just connections between objects and the constraint node.**

Maya is designed this way because, 30 years ago, computers did not have as much memory or processing power as today. To avoid unnecessary data processing, they invented nodes, whose **inputs and outputs can be marked as "dirty" or "clean."** Picture this: you're doing laundry and **only want to wash the clothes that are dirty**. So, **every time you go somewhere muddy, you mark that day's outfit as dirty so you know to wash it later**. After it's washed, you mark it clean. This saves unnecessary work, rather than re-calculating everything, Maya only processes the "dirty" data to clean it.

***

Furthermore, when coding, if you want to manipulate something, nodes provide a clear structure. Maya has a thing called **MObject** that can reference any node. Picture this: **the node is a television, and MObject is a signal pointer** that can point to the television. After linking the pointer to the television, you can **pack the pointer** with buttons and a case to make it a remote, so you can actually use it.

Just as in the code here: **get the object** (signal pointer) to **point to the selected object** (television), **use MFn to pack it** (add a case and buttons), and then use it.
