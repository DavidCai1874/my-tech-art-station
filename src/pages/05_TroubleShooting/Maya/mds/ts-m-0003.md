When you are trying to aim constrain one object to the another, you might look at the window and think "what are all these parameters."

I'm not going to explain them all in this article, but I'll explain what these vectors do.

1\. The **Aim Vector** is the simplest, which axis you want the cone point to the cube. If it's y, then the value will be [0, 1, 0], because it's [x, y, z].

And if I want the middle of y and x axis pointing to the cube, it will be [1, 1, 0]. Becuase it is calculating the weight of each axis, if both axis has the weight of 1 pointing to the cube, then the result will be the middle.

2\. Let's take about the **World up vector** next, because we need to understand this before we figure out what Up vector is. In easy words, this means which axis of the world is pointing up. Usually it's the Y-axis in Maya, so we just leave the World up vector's [x, y, z] as [0, 1, 0].

Or there's an easy solution, set this as scene up, so you can know which axis is up by looking at the lower left corner in your 3d scene.

3\. Now let's talk about the **Up vector.** This is a supportive secondary value to dicide which axis should be pointing up. The weight of this is lower than Aim vector, which means if your Aim vector already points the Y-axis to the side, and you set the Up vector's y value as up, it's going to use the aim vector's y value and ignore the up vector. As I said, it's only a supportive value, you can leave it to [0, 0, 0] if you just want your object to point the another and don't care which axis is pointing up.

For example, when the cone is already pointing the cube, it will no longer point up. So the Up vector's [0, 1, 0] value is equavalent to [0, 0, 0].

But let's change for another example. If I want the X-axis (the extruded part) be pointing up, while my Y-axis is point to the white frame cube. What I do here is to set the Aim vector to [0, 1, 0], which means Y-axis is pointing to the far side cube. And the Up vector to [1, 0, 0], which means, after it points the Y-axis to the far side cube, try to make X-axis point up if possible.

Again, Y to the far side cube, and X up if possible.

FYI, there are weird ways like set the World up vector as [1, 0, 0], which means X-axis up, and set Up vector to [1, 0, 0] too to get the same result as normal Y pointing up. But it's too weird and too illogical, so stick with world's Y-axis up, and you're good.
