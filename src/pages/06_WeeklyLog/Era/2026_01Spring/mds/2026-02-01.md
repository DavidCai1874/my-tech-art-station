Group:

Took a break for personal things.

Friday meeting - bootproj works. It was a misundertstand, I thought it was school pc, but turned out to be captain's.

Sample textures will come in two weeks, I'll be working on the bootproj and other things for now.

Worked on file filtering and updated a test boot v2 for teammates to test and see.
