Website 404 problem: website doesn't know where to find pages other than the main page

These two lines of code make sure the website knows where to find pages.

These codes can automatically generate information files, so I can just write my doc, and the codes will put the doc onto my website for me.

Another bug...

Picture this: you ask the computer to eat, and it looks at the table, asking where are the "plates." You go check the plates for so many times, in so many different ways, there's nothing wrong. Until you realize, you asked the computer to eat before the food was cooked, that's the reason...

The solution is simple: ask it to eat after the food is ready.

Checking out .usd file - more on building the pipeline.

Two problems before starting that: **what software we use to animate; do we version control Unreal Engine.**

Wrote a doc about: [how to export animation in Maya to UE with FBX file format](http://localhost:5173/my-tech-art-station/troubleshooting/pipeline/ts-p-0001) (*show the website changes)

Behind the scene for that doc:

All bugs come from "Constraint failed."

No mesh; cap not working; need to bake simulation to move...

Trying look into animting in Unreal, but we need to rig in that, which is not as efficient as doing it in Maya.

Modular rigs: rigs in Maya cannot be migrated here.

Controls not working, and limits are lost too.

Adrian and I talked, we are both more familiar with rigging in Maya. So, animating in UE is not the most efficient way of doing this.

Checking Maya Unreal live link, ran into bugs... I'll deal with that next week.

Plans: 
- \-Sept 17th - 24th : Maya Unreal Live Link and Perforce.
- \-Sept 24th - milestone1 : building the pipeline for the team.

We switched to [Confluence](https://projectdeepnet.atlassian.net/wiki/x/2wEB).
