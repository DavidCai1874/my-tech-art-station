# How To Import Animation From Maya To Unreal Engine 5
## TS-P-0001
### 2025-09-11

The Unreal Engine version I use is **5.6.1**.
The Maya version I use is **2024**.

Abstract:
- \-Export geo and skeleton, check **"Animation" and "Bake Animation"** when exportion as FBX.
- \-Import into Unreal scene, drag the **animation sequence** onto the **skeletal mesh's detail** as an **animation asset**, and play.

***

First, **clean the model history** before skinning. Once the rig works and weight painting is  finished, do your animation.

I will use this bottle with a simple animation as the first example.

1\. Select **all the geo** that you want to export.

2\. Hold **Shift** and select the root of the **skeletion** (not the control rings!).

3\. Go to **top left corner -> File**, choose **"Export Selection"**.

4\. On the **right side** of the pop-up window. **Check "Animation" and "Bake Animation,"** and set the start and end. This step is very important.

5\. Set your path and export the fbx, on the "Warnings and Errors" pop-up window, **the only possible thing there should be "Complex animation baked."** If you find there's another warning looks likes this, saying **"Constraints export failed", please make sure you did step 4 correctly.** If there's a skin definition warning, please make sure the model history is cleaned before skinning.

6\. The exporting now is done! Open your scene in UE5, find a folder, and drag the fbx we just exported into the content broswer.

7\. In the new pop-up window, make sure **"Import Animations"** is checked.

8\. There will be a list of things, don't worry, **only the first two matters**.

9\. Drag the **pink one**, aka the **"Skeletal Mesh"** into your scene. Adjust it's scale and position if you want to.

10\. On the right side, in "Details," go to **Animation -> Animation Mode**, and change it to **"Use Animation Asset."**

11\.  Drag **the deep green** one, aka **"Animation Sequence" to  "Anim to Play."** That slot should have a blue hightlight.

12\. Once you done that, **hit play button** and it should be moving!
