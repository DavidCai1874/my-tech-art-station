# Github Page 404 For React + Vite Setup
## TS-G-0002

Abstract:
1. 1\. Go to .github -> workflows -> **deploy.yml**
2. 2\. **Add this code after "npm run build"**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Copy index.html to 404.html
      run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html
    ```

When I deploy my website, the main page works well, but subpages cannot load.

The reason is that I'm using **React + Vite** (imagine a bunch of LEGO pieces and a group of people helping you build). In this setup, there's **only one real index.html** file, and all the pages you see are just rendering different LEGO pieces inside that single file.

But GitHub doesn't know this. **It assumes every route (like /troubleshooting) should have its own index.html (/troubleshooting/index.html)**. Since such files don’t exist, GitHub throws a 404 error.

The solution is to **redirect GitHub’s 404 back to your actual index.html**. Once it's your index file again, everything will render correctly.

Picture this: you **try to walk through a portal, but the exit portal isn't open yet**, so you hit a wall (404 page). By copying index.html into 404.html, it's like opening the other side of the portal. Now you can travel through.

In your folder, go to **.github -> workflows -> deploy.yml**:

In deploy.yml, after the build step, add these two lines **after "npm run build"**,because it's copying index.html from the dist folder which is created after the build:

```yaml
- \-name: Copy index.html to 404.html
  run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html
```

**Commit and push to GitHub**. Wait for the website to deploy and now things should work as expected.
