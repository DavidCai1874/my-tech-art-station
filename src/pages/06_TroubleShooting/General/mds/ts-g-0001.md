# How Do I Organize My Articles For This Website
## TS-G-0001
### 2025-09-14

This article is relatively technical. Reading it before you sleep can guarantee a good night's sleep.

Abstract:
- \-Set up routers, make the folder structure clear, and ensure files can be found by following a specific route.
- \-Write the markdown in a specific format, and create code to collect information based on that format.

For example, this article itself looks like this in the folder:

In simple terms, it's like finding an address without Google Maps: **find someone to ask, they will tell you to go to a certain area, and ask someone else there.**

The structure is like this (let's say you want to visit a friend in Edmonton, Canada):

**App.jsx** (The main router. Like the person who tells you which country to go to—let's say Canada.)

↓

**06_TroubleShooting_Router.jsx** (A sub-router, including the route to the troubleshooting page itself. As you arrive in BC, this person tells you which province to go to next—choices include BC itself, but let's say AB for now.)

↓

**TS_General_Router.jsx** (Another sub-router, including the route to the general page itself. As you arrive in Calgary, AB, this is the person telling you which city you're going to next. The choices include Calgary itself, but let's say you're going to Edmonton next.)

↓

**TS_General_MD.jsx** (When an article on the general page is clicked, it will search for the corresponding data in the .js file based on the URL and render the info + markdown content. As you arrive in Edmonton, you want to go to your friend's apartment—you know what street it's on and you have a map in your hand, so you don't need to ask anyone now.)

↑ *imported*

**TS_General.js** (Stores all the information about the article: title, id, date, and where to find it.)

↑ *info collected by code*

**ts-g-0001.md** (the article)

It's the process of **gradually narrowing things down to a certain point**. As long as **routers are set correctly, and folder structure and naming conventions are clear**, the only problem is "how do I gather information into that .js file" — aka "how do they make the map?"

***

Two things need to be right: **markdown format and code reading the format.**

This is the beginning of the markdown file for this article. **Every one of my troubleshooting articles has these three lines.**

With that as the format, I crafted a bunch of code for getting info from that. It looks pretty scary in terms of numbers, but they only do three things: **make lists and numbers in my article readable, gather information, and gather information for the search bar.**

First, putting `-` and `1.` at the beginning of a sentence in a markdown file will make it a list. In normal markdown rendering, it shows `-` and `1.`, but for my website, it doesn't. So, I have to use code to format that. Here's what it does to make my website render these two things correctly:

Second, gathering information — in simple terms, the code goes into markdown files, reads the first three lines, and throws the info into another file. Very simple. The result ends up like this:

Third, gathering info for the search bar. Since my website is not running in real time on a server or anything, the best way to do a search bar is to have a list of all existing articles, and searching is just finding information from that list based on name or id. So, the search bar file for this ends up like this:

And the search result:

To sum up, the result of these codes helping me is: I just need to write my markdown with a certain template, and the code will do everything else for me. How amazing technology is :D
