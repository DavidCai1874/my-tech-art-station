# What Are the Vectors in an Aim Constraint

When you aim-constrain one object to another, the constraint window can be confusing. This article explains what the vectors do.

1. The **Aim Vector** is the simplest: it specifies which axis should point to the target. For example, Y is [0, 1, 0] because the vector is [x, y, z].

If you want a direction halfway between Y and X, use [1, 1, 0]. The values act as weights for each axis; if both X and Y have weight 1, the result is the diagonal between them.

2. The **World Up Vector** specifies which world axis is "up." In Maya this is usually the Y-axis, so the World Up Vector is [0, 1, 0]. Alternatively, set it to "scene up" so you can check the scene's lower-left corner to see which axis is up.

3. The **Up Vector** is a secondary value that helps decide which axis should point up. It is considered after the Aim Vector, so if the Aim Vector already defines the object's up direction (for example, it aligns the Y-axis with the target), the Up Vector will be ignored. If you don't care about the object's up orientation, you can leave the Up Vector as [0, 0, 0].

For example, when the cone is already pointing at the cube, the Up Vector [0, 1, 0] is equivalent to [0, 0, 0].

If you want the X-axis (the extruded part) to point up while the Y-axis points to the white frame cube, set the Aim Vector to [0, 1, 0] (Y to the cube) and the Up Vector to [1, 0, 0] (try to make X point up when possible).

FYI: you can set the World Up Vector to [1, 0, 0] (X-up) and the Up Vector to [1, 0, 0] to get a similar result, but that's unusual. Stick with the world's Y-axis as up and you'll be fine.
