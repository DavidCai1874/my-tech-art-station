# What If I Only Keyframed Viewport Visibility In Blender 
## TS-P-0001
### 2025-09-15

The Blender version I use is **4.1.1**.

Abstract:
1. 1\. 3D Viewport -> View -> Viewport Render Animation
2. 2\. Or use this code to sync viewport visibility to render: [https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Blender-Viewport-Visibility-to-Render](https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Blender-Viewport-Visibility-to-Render)

In Blender, you can insert a keyframe for visibility. However, there is a very annoying feature: **visibility in the viewport does not sync with render visibility**.

For example, if you uncheck the viewport visibility of the default cube, this is how it looks in the viewport â€” empty.

But when you render the image, the cube is still there.

It will not disappear in your render view until the render visibility is also unchecked, like this:

If you're rendering a still image, it's fine to manually uncheck the box. But if you're working on an animation that heavily relies on visibility, it's illogical to fix it by hand. So, there are two ways to solve this.

My example scene looks like this in the viewport:

But something that should be hidden appears in the render view.

The **first way is to render your animation based on the viewport**:

1\. At the top right corner of Blender, there are several buttons.

2\. Turn these two off. Your viewport should be clean now.

3\. Go to **3D View -> View -> Viewport Render Image/Animation**, and choose the one you need.

4\. The result should be good and clean now.

This method has the disadvantage of being only an emergency solution. **If you are looking for high-quality rendering in Cycles, please use the code below.**

The **second way is to use code to sync the visibility keyframes**, allowing you to hit the real render button and get the correct result after a snack and a nap.

Long story short, **the code is here**: [https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Blender-Viewport-Visibility-to-Render](https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Blender-Viewport-Visibility-to-Render)

The GitHub page includes documentation on how to use it, so I won't repeat the instructions here. The result is: **it inserts a render visibility keyframe when the object appears or disappears in the viewport.**

The rendering works!

There's an addon version of this code. If you're interested in the background story or want to do more visibility animation in the future, check this out: [Viewport And Render Visibility Sync Addon](https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/addons/blender/b-c-001)
