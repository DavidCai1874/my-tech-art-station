# Why My Final Render Has Flickering Lights And Renders Slowly
## TS-UE-0001
### 2025-09-16

Abstract:
- \-Set lights to static.
- \-Build all levels.

***

Here's part of the render result from one of my UE projects. The **result has an area that constantly flashes, and the whole render for a 40 second clip takes 10 minutes**. Looking in detail, you can see the light on the arm in the first image is stronger, while in the second it is darker.

The **problem comes from the lights.** When you look at the scene, there's a **red X** beside the lights, which indicates an issue.

Let's use this light as an example.

When you go into the details of the light, there's a section called **"Mobility."** When it's set to **"Movable" or "Stationary," the render will calculate the light in real time for every frame**. Because the light is bouncing on surfaces and the energy on the surface might be different each second, the render result will have that flickering effect. Plus, real-time lighting calculations take much more time.

So, before rendering, **setting this to "Static"** helps because when you **build the level** later, these static lights will be calculated and baked into the scene. The energy is static, which **solves the flickering problem** and **greatly decreases the rendering time**.

The light looks like this after being set to static.

**Before rendering, build the scene.** This way, these lights will not be rendered in real time.

Now the render result should be fast and correct.
